Thanks for checking out our hi-fi prototype! 

Operating Instructions:
Our prototype was developed in React Native with Node.js. Here, we provide an .apk file that can be installed on Android phones and a link to access the prototype via an online hosted service. 
In order to run the prototype on your local Android phone, follow these steps:

1. Download the .apk file
2. Enable .apk installation from unknown sources (note: you might get some warnings that the app isn't verified by Google Play Store)
3. Launch the app! 

Limitations:
Due to the time constraints of the class, many features that would be present in the final product have been omitted from this prototype.
Please note that:
* All data on the app is hard-coded.
* Searching will only trigger results for the "watch" keyword and other search terms will not yield results
